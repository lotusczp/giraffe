# The Giraffe Language
Giraffe is an object-oriented script language written in C++/Qt. The intention is to embed into a C++ application to extend flexibility and functionality (like Lua). And it's rather an example that shows with full implementation how a lauguage interpreter works.

## Design idea
Giraffe is designed under the idea "Achieving a goal through one and only one right way". The grammar is like Python while the "{}" is used for blocks instead of indent.

## Status
The project is in alpha stage: still tweaking the language and standard library.
